# bio-v3

A link-in-bio linktree concept. Uses a minimalist monotone (unless you hover on the links) design philosophy. Uses sans serif fonts, and different color intensities for emphasis/de-emphasis. Layout animations for switching between hovered links was accomplished using Framer Motion's `LayoutGroup` and `AnimatePresence` features (along with `<motion.div>` components, of course). Other animations were done using TailwindCSS.
