# Swiss Collection: Link In Bio Template

A template made by Vidit Khandelwal for [Snippetopia](https://snippetopia.xyz), a collection of free and open-source React, Next.js, Tailwind, and Framer Motion snippets and templates. Check out the [Swiss collection](https://snippetopia.xyz/swiss) , or fork this template and make it own!

This template uses a minimalist monotone (unless you hover on the links) design philosophy. Uses sans serif fonts, and different color intensities for emphasis/de-emphasis. Layout animations for switching between hovered links was accomplished using Framer Motion's `LayoutGroup` and `AnimatePresence` features (along with `<motion.div>` components, of course). Other animations were done using TailwindCSS. It uses Overused Grotesk, a free to use font.
